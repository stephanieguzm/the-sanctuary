# The Sanctuary

## About the Project
[Project Spec - Part I](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html)

The Sanctuary is a hotel management tool for customers to manage room bookings. Customers login to their hotel dashboard and see their past and upcoming bookings. 

A customer can search for available rooms by date and room type and reserve a room with the click or press of a button. 

If a room isn't available, the customer is notified and encouraged to alter their search. They can then return to their dashboard where they can see their new and previous bookings.
